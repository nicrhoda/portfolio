        <p id="about-me-content">
            I grew up in a small farming town Chenoa IL and went to school at Prairie Central in nearby Fairbury.
            I then started attending classes at Heartland Community College in Normal while working full time.
            Since then I have recently begun the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and have so far learned how to use 
            HTML and CSS to build websites.  I have always been interested in technology and really enjoyed the basic
            web developement course I took at Heartland and wanted to see if I could use the bootcamp to try to get into 
            the field.
